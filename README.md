# Feature-Player_Single_Double_Jump

This project shows how to make player jump in Unity. Player can make single, double even triple jump if you want him to. You will also learn about PowerUps feature in this game. The player can make single jump anytime. But he can only double jump if he gets a PowerUp and that too for a specific period of time.
